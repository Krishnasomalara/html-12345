      <p>
        I recently started taking an interest in web development as a hobby to stay busy along with my college work as well as my internship preparation. I do have a liking for C and Python, but I am working on getting better. Now, thanks to web development, I can say I know HTML and CSS (not yet reached the JavaScript part).

          "I can beat you in any sport you choose. I don't play for fun; I play to WIN. Because, as the greats say:<br>
          'Being second is being the first one to lose.'<br>
          I thrive on competition, and every game, every challenge, is a battlefield where only the strongest survive. Winning isn't just a goalâ€”it's the only option."
